It can help them avoid investments that conflict with their mission, and so protect them against reputational risk. Designing a portfolio with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in mind can substantially improve its long-term risk/return profile, helping to manage risk on the portfolio level as well.\\n\\nSustainable investments can also help foundations support their mission with targeted investments that make a positive impact in the areas they concentrate on while also generating a financial return. Alternative investments in sustainable real estate, to take one example, can help diversify and add performance to a portfolio – a welcome addition in today's low-interest environment – while reducing a foundation's carbon footprint.\\n\\nWhile sustainable investing has many advantages, it is not a straightforward process. Investors must have a clear understanding of the criteria they are using, and the means to screen all their investments against these criteria. There are also different screening approaches to choose from, from those which exclude investments in companies linked to certain controversial activities (negative screening) to those that actively seek out sustainably managed companies (positive screening) to approaches focusing on specific themes that support the foundation’s mission.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by Salesforce\\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/\",\n",

The growing impact investment market provides capital to address the world’s most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by Salesforce\\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/\",\n",

       "     '_textBody': \"Sustainable investing offers foundations many potential benefits. It can help them avoid investments that conflict with their mission, and so protect them against reputational risk. Designing a portfolio with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in mind can substantially improve its long-term risk/return profile, helping to manage risk on the portfolio level as well.\\n\\nSustainable investments can also help foundations support their mission with targeted investments that make a positive impact in the areas they concentrate on while also generating a financial return. Alternative investments in sustainable real estate, to take one example, can help diversify and add performance to a portfolio – a welcome addition in today's low-interest environment – while reducing a foundation's carbon footprint.\\n\\nWhile sustainable investing has many advantages, it is not a straightforward process. Investors must have a clear understanding of the criteria they are using, and the means to screen all their investments against these criteria. There are also different screening approaches to choose from, from those which exclude investments in companies linked to certain controversial activities (negative screening) to those that actively seek out sustainably managed companies (positive screening) to approaches focusing on specific themes that support the foundation’s mission.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by Salesforce\\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/\",\n",

It can help them avoid investments that conflict with their mission, and so protect them against reputational risk. Designing a portfolio with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in mind can substantially improve its long-term risk/return profile, helping to manage risk on the portfolio level as well.\\n\\nSustainable investments can also help foundations support their mission with targeted investments that make a positive impact in the areas they concentrate on while also generating a financial return. Alternative investments in sustainable real estate, to take one example, can help diversify and add performance to a portfolio – a welcome addition in today's low-interest environment – while reducing a foundation's carbon footprint.\\n\\nWhile sustainable investing has many advantages, it is not a straightforward process. Investors must have a clear understanding of the criteria they are using, and the means to screen all their investments against these criteria. There are also different screening approaches to choose from, from those which exclude investments in companies linked to certain controversial activities (negative screening) to those that actively seek out sustainably managed companies (positive screening) to approaches focusing on specific themes that support the foundation’s mission.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by Salesforce\\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/\",\n",

It can help them avoid investments that conflict with their mission, and so protect them against reputational risk. Designing a portfolio with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in mind can substantially improve its long-term risk/return profile, helping to manage risk on the portfolio level as well.\\n\\nSustainable investments can also help foundations support their mission with targeted investments that make a positive impact in the areas they concentrate on while also generating a financial return. Alternative investments in sustainable real estate, to take one example, can help diversify and add performance to a portfolio – a welcome addition in today's low-interest environment – while reducing a foundation's carbon footprint.\\n\\nWhile sustainable investing has many advantages, it is not a straightforward process. Investors must have a clear understanding of the criteria they are using, and the means to screen all their investments against these criteria. There are also different screening approaches to choose from, from those which exclude investments in companies linked to certain controversial activities (negative screening) to those that actively seek out sustainably managed companies (positive screening) to approaches focusing on specific themes that support the foundation’s mission.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by Salesforce\\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/\",\n",

       "     '_textBody': \"Sustainable investing offers foundations many potential benefits. It can help them avoid investments that conflict with their mission, and so protect them against reputational risk. Designing a portfolio with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in mind can substantially improve its long-term risk/return profile, helping to manage risk on the portfolio level as well.\\n\\nSustainable investments can also help foundations support their mission with targeted investments that make a positive impact in the areas they concentrate on while also generating a financial return. Alternative investments in sustainable real estate, to take one example, can help diversify and add performance to a portfolio – a welcome addition in today's low-interest environment – while reducing a foundation's carbon footprint.\\n\\nWhile sustainable investing has many advantages, it is not a straightforward process. Investors must have a clear understanding of the criteria they are using, and the means to screen all their investments against these criteria. There are also different screening approaches to choose from, from those which exclude investments in companies linked to certain controversial activities (negative screening) to those that actively seek out sustainably managed companies (positive screening) to approaches focusing on specific themes that support the foundation’s mission.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by Salesforce\\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/\",\n",
